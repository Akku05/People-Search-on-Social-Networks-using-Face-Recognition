People-Search-on-Social-Networks-using-Face-Recognition
=======================================================

Face recognition app for android – Two options provided – Either a Video or an image. If a video is selected, the video is converted into frames
and then a face detection is done on the frames and only the frames with faces are displayed in a grid view. 
Once the image is selected, the image is sent to a server for face recognition and 
the response is sent back to the server which would be the name of the person recognized in the image. All this is done using a PHP script. 
Then the user is searched on Facebook , Linkedin , Twitter and Google + using the name which was returned after face recognition.
